About
-----

JSXGraph is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting,
charting, and data visualization in a web browser. It is implemented completely
in JavaScript, does not rely on any other library, and uses SVG, VML, or canvas.
JSXGraph is easy to embed and has a small footprint: less than 100 KByte if
embedded in a web page. No plug-ins are required! Special care has been taken
to optimize the performance.

Starting with version 0.80, JSXGraph supports multitouch devices like the Apple
iPad. Since version 0.82 the canvas element is supported, too. That means,
JSXGraph also runs on Android devices.

JSXGraph is developed at the
Lehrstuhl f√ºr Mathematik und ihre Didaktik
University of Bayreuth, Germany

Build JSXGraph
--------------

In order to build JSXGraph you need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.6+. First, install all
dependencies required to build JSXGraph using npm in the JSXGraph root directory:

    $ npm install

This will create a new subdirectory ```node_modules``` in the JSXGraph root directory which holds
all tools and libraries required to build ```jsxgraphcore.js``` and run JSXGraph inside node. To build
JSXGraph run

    $ make core

which will output an unminified version of ```jsxgraphcore.js``` in ```build/bin```. To build a minified
version run

    $ make core-min


Usage
-----

Include jsxgraphcore.js and, if required, one or more file readers in your HTML
file. For further usage instructions please consult our [wiki](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/)
especially our [tutorials](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Documentation)
or [the API reference docs](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/docs/).
