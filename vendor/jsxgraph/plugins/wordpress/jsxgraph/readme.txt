Using the JSXGraph filter makes it a lot easier to embed JSXGraph constructions into wordpress pages/posts.

== Description ==

[JSXGraph](http://www.jsxgraph.org/) is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting, graphs, and data visualization in a web browser. It is implemented completely in JavaScript and uses SVG and VML.
JSXGraph is easy to embed and has a small footprint: only about 80 KB if embedded in a web page. No plug-ins are required! 
[JSXGraph](http://www.jsxgraph.org/) is developed at the [Lehrstuhl für Mathematik und ihre Didaktik](http://did.mat.uni-bayreuth.de/), [University of Bayreuth](http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/), Germany.


== Installation ==

Caution:
The current version has to be regarded as a development version. Use with caution!

Installation: (by Admin)<br/>
1. Upload the complete folder "jsxgraph" into your blogs plugins folder (wp-content/plugins)<br/>
2. Navigate to the admin panel, there to your plugins and activate the JSXGraph plugin<br/>
optional:<br/>
3. Remove the javascript-files in the plugins-folder in order to load the current version<br/>
   from the jsxgraph-website (same for the stylesheet).<br/>

Usage:<br/>
1. Open a a blog post or new page and<br/>
2. write your desired content. At the position the construction should appear, create a construction by:<br/>
	* switching to the code input<br/>
	* inserting a &lt;jsxgraph&gt;-tag with all required parameters<br/>
	* NOTE: you do have to surround the &lt;jsxgraph&gt;-tag with &lt;pre&gt;&lt;jsxgraph ...&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br/>

Be aware of the fact, that you dont't see the construction unless you leave the editor and save your document.
